# Depth perception using Mono camera

## Overview

The depth perception module aims to combine computer vision concepts with image processing
techniques to estimate the distance of the human from the camera. We aim to explore the
Histogram of Gradients (HOG) feature extractor as a human face feature detector and apply
pioneering image processing techniques based on pin hole camera concept to provide accurate
depth results.
